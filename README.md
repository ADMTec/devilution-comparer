# Devilution-comparer

Small binary comparison helper tool for devilution.

Generates an orig.asm and a compare.asm in the current directory and watches the respective *.pdb for changes.

Use `--help` for parameter guidance.

Example call:

```plain
devilution-comparer.exe path\to\Diablo_orig.exe 0x303EF devilution\bld\Diablo.exe InitMonsterTRN
```

## Requirements

This uses Rust in the 2018 edition (so currently nightly only).

Since the `pdb` crate doesn't support the old PDB file format generated by VC++ < 7 yet,
you will need to put `cvdump.exe` from https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-pdb/tree/master/cvdump
into the folder of the binary. (This currently makes this program windows-only as well :c)
